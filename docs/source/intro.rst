Intro: shell environment
=========================

Before starting to program: in many cases, you cannot avoid using your **terminal emulator**.
It may sound awful, but it can in reality simplify your life as a programmer in many ways.

Just don't worry, and let's start familiarizing yourself!

What is the terminal emulator?
-------------------------------

A terminal emulator, or just a "terminal" in short, is a character-based environment to interact with your computer.

Where are they?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


A historical background of "terminals"
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the ancient ages, people did not use to have their own "personal" computers.
They instead used to connect to the "main-frame" computer, which they shared with everyone else, using a device called "terminal".

A typical terminal consisted of a keyboard and a monitor. In most cases, they did not have any graphical user interface (e.g. desktops, icons etc.), so they communicate with the main frame only by typing *commands* to the terminal.
The terminal sends it to the main frame, which in turn sends the response back to the terminal that displays it in its monitor.

As you can imagine, it was a non-trivial duty for all novice users to learn the commands to communicate with the main frame, but that was the way how the "real programmers" grew up in those days.

As we all know, the age of real programmers is gone. We have graphical user interfaces, with lots of user-friendly functionalities, that makes it easier to familiarize ourselves and interact with our computers. Instead of us learning how to talk to it, the computer now has a persona that has interfaces intuitive for us.

On the other hand, the nice old character-based interface has not cease to exist (yet). Since they are not literally "terminals" anymore, so they are instead called "terminal *emulators*".

But why bother? Because the character-based (command-based) interfaces still outperforms graphical user interfaces in a certain aspect of computing: automation. When it comes to telling a computer how to perform a sequence of tasks on a set of files in a batch, writing a list of commands remains to be one of the most simple and secure approaches.

As an example, you can think of copying a piece of text from Microsoft Excel and pasting it into TextEdit again and again. For us human beings, it is just about repeating of the same procedure. But how can you tell the computer about what to do? It would be a bit difficult to tell it *graphically*, and you would have to resort to using a certain *language*. This is where the terminals have their advantages.


Basic commands
---------------

There are in fact *hundreds* of "basic commands" -- so large in variety
that you can do most of your routine works on the terminal!

But it is not realistic to learn everything from the beginning
(and we are going to learn Python anyway, which is easier to learn
step by step).
So here I list a couple of commands that are essential when
managing files from the terminal.

``cd``

``ls``
~~~~~~

``mkdir``
~~~~~~~~~

``mv``
~~~~~~

``cp``
~~~~~~

``rm``
